            The silent heroes of the land. The strong, decisive, caring and resilient.
            The mothers, daughters, sisters and friends. They are the women of the land.

            Growing up, I have fond memories of many women living and working within my rural
            community and as a young woman I found myself being surrounded by these loving,
            determined and family orientated ladies. I was always amazed by the contributions
            they brought to their homes, businesses and rural landscapes.
