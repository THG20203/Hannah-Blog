        This post has been a difficult one to sit down and write and has taken
        me a number of weeks to actually pick up the courage to do so by putting
        the words down to describe how I'm feeling. All I can say is I'm
        struggling and feel as though a blow out is on the way! I'm exhausted,
        I'm drained, mentally, physically and in all other ways I possibly
        could be. I can only describe it as standing in a hurricane that I
        just can't distance myself from. I just have no focus and just want
        to curl up in a ball and sleep!

        The past number of weeks have probably been the most stressful and
        emotional I have experienced in a long time. Feelings of anger and
        upset have raced through my mental health like a tornado and left
        feelings of what can only be described as emptiness and disappointment.
        In brief, I was supposed to have gone on a fortnight holiday to
        Canada for a friends wedding and to wave my brother off on his new
        adventure working in the Canadian agricultural sector. However due
        to a serious communication mistake from a recruitment company, the
        holiday was delayed by a week and in the end it ended up with me being
        unable to travel. Thankfully, my brother eventually reached his
        destination, and daily videos, messages and pictures are proving he
        is thoroughly enjoying his time out there so far.

        The past three to four months however have become a very big reality
        check for me, and one which I am still trying to get my head around.
        Why? Primarily because I no longer have my brother alongside me as my
        support mechanism when it comes to working on the family farm. He was
        always the 'banter' that was needed when others were constantly being
        stressed about jobs or clueless about what urgently needed to be done
        and he would always give me a gentle reminder if I had forgotten to do
        something. We worked as a team who surprisingly enjoyed working together
        through laughter and music and just plain, laid back, get the job done
        attitudes.

        As previously mentioned in my blog post 'If you truly believe', I
        explained how I have achieved a lot more than I believed I ever could
        over the past four years of working and learning within the UK
        agricultural sector. I'm proud of the places I have been and the
        practical experiences I have gained along the way. However, along
        this four year journey I have always had a certain dream in which
        to have my own livestock on our family farm.

        Last summer that dream had started to become reality when I had
        purchased my own small flock of Lleyn ewe lambs in order for me to start
        lambing again on the farm in 2019 after selling off all the previous
        breeding ewes in 2015 due to the grandparents ill health.

        I've recently taken the next step and purchased more yearling ewes this
        year, along with a ram to add to my already small flock in the hope
        that it grows into something bigger, and fingers crossed, better.

        However, there's a but, and a very big but. I'm scared. I'm scared of
        failing, of not knowing what I'm doing or if I'm doing it right. This,
        paired with this exhausted feeling I'm experiencing at the same time
        has made me feel a lack of enthusiasm for doing anything that excites
        me which really isn't helping. I simply do not care about anything and
        it's starting to really annoy me. I've had chaos coming from all angles
        over the last several weeks and I don't know what to do, I don't know
        what to say and I just have this constant hazy feeling floating around
        in my head and it just makes me feel completely numb! I can feel myself
        getting easily annoyed at others or unresponsive because I'm so
        exhausted and it recently took a sudden melt down in a car park at
        night, when I couldn't find a parking space to realise something
        wasn't right (stupid right?).

        The small amount of experience I have gained within farming, along with
        the small amount of knowledge my brother had, almost felt like a comfort
        blanket. However, I get the awful feeling that I am starting to be
        criticised again and given negative statements like I used to recieve
        before I left the country initially, giving me the sense that people
        think I don't know what I am doing. I almost feel that from these
        negative comments and blunt statements, that certain individuals feel
        that because I am trying to improve on what I have, that they are
        jealous of what I can gain and potentially achieve from my dreams.
        But then I question if I am just being silly? Just because my brother
        has left, doesn't mean life can't carry on as normal right?

        The places I have worked and visited, I have been lucky enough to
        encounter on my own. Therefore, unless I have put the odd post up on
        my social media pages, these negative individuals haven't necessarily
        seen or understood the work I have done and knowledge I have gained.
        I like to think that these experiences should have proven that I'm not
        afraid to learn, and enabled me to gain the confidence to move forward
        with my individual plans.

        Part of me feels as though I need a mentor, some guidance, some support
        or as the title of this blog says, just a helping hand to provide me
        with a gentle reminder of when I should and shouldn't be doing certain
        jobs. Someone who can provide enthusiasm to a younger person trying
        to enter into an already difficult industry. Now some people reading
        this may query that I surely have this knowledge at home already with
        certain people, but my response would be that I wouldn't be writing
        this post if I didn't feel I needed the help would I? Therefore if
        anyone reading this knows of any useful apps, articles or tools that
        may be able to guide me I would be very grateful of any advice given.

        I suppose what I am delaying is actually putting on my big girl pants
        and just getting on with the job. Giving myself that little talking to
        and just getting on with it. I just hate the fact I'm back hating the
        negativity of this world that dragged me down initially before I started
        travelling, the negativity that when someone is trying to grow as an
        individual and achieve their dreams, that people would rather attack
        with unfavourable comments rather than positive, supportive ones. For
        me, this constant negativity sends me on a downward spiral to a chaotic
        space that I just can't control.

        I know what I need to do to get out of this mind set, however it's
        proving very difficult to do so at the moment. Most evenings I take
        the dogs for a walk around the fields of home farm. It's where I get
        to experience some quiet time, a time to let my brain breath, where I
        can simply be on my own and just enjoy the empty space. It may sound
        crazy, especially as we are living in a very hectic, fast paced world,
        but, I love silence. I just love sitting, walking and thinking in
        complete utter silence, but it's proving harder and harder to obtain.
        Most of the time silence and quiet spaces give me back the required
        focus in my life and taking in the smells and sounds of what's around
        me, it usually puts me in a happier place even if it's only for a short
        while. I always get this much needed space when I'm up in the mountains
        of either Mid or North Wales and definitely when I'm in Scotland,
        therefore maybe a trip to the mountains is all I need.
