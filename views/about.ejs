              “Superior quality, attention to detail and an optimistic mindset are some of the traits which have stayed with me throughout both my careers of Fashion and Farming. The satisfaction of producing things well, which can stand the test of time, is greatly rewarding and has shown me on many occasions, through rain and shine, laughter and tears that all the hard work is worth it.
              Farming has been in my veins since the day I was born.”

              “Being brought up on my small family farm in rural South Wales, some of my earliest memories included days filled with either young livestock or large machinery and always surrounded by good food and family members. However, growing up, my education and early career path steered me down a different industrial route of fashion design and garment creation and presented me with a variety of opportunities to work in a number of fashion sectors in Wales and also a short period of time overseas.”

              “Unfortunately, in 2014, after several years of unknowingly battling depression and anxiety I sadly experienced a mental health breakdown which took me away from the fast paced fashion career I had lived and breathed for 13 years. After several counselling sessions and encouraging support from family and friends I made the decision to re-route and  embark on a new journey of calf rearing and working within the New Zealand dairy sector, a country I had dreamt about travelling to since the age of eighteen. After seven months of hard work, new found friends and amazing experiences, returning from New Zealand my farming journey didn’t stop there. I enjoyed the change in lifestyle so much that I continued to gain further experience by working for a few years on different sheep farming systems in both Wales and Scotland before eventually deciding to take the plunge and purchase my own flock of sheep to farm and manage back on my family farm in South Wales. Farming became my therapy and the Welsh landscape became my new office.”

            <p class="about-content__text">
              From fashion to farming, my journey has only been possible because of the amazing people who have shared their knowledge and provided me with the opportunities to learn. I will forever be inspired by the skills and craftsmanship of the generations before me and the knowledge and stories they share. The farming industry is tough, but with an optimistic and resilient mindset, as farmers, producers and workmates, I believe we can continue to produce high quality food whilst being proud of the work we do for our UK farming industry.”
