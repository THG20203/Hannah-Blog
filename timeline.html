          2014
          I quit my job, bought a ticket and travelled to the other side of the
          world to live and work on a dairy farm in New Zealand.
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-container__item second-timeline">
          2015
          I returned home after 7 months away but still couldn't settle so
          continued my agricultural work experience in West Wales and Scotland
          (seasonally lambing for a number of years).
          Got myself a new job working in one section of the agricultural
          industry as well as starting an Agricultural degree part time.
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-container__item third-timeline">
          2017
          Changed jobs but remained within the agricultural industry.
          A job which I could work with farmers as well as broaden my knowledge
          on UK farming systems and where I am still working today.
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-container__item fourth-timeline">
          2018
          Completed and gained a Foundation degree in Agriculture and decided to top it up to a full degree over a couple more years, all whilst working full time. I purchased my own small flock of sheep to start putting into practice what I had been learning since 2014.
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-container__item fifth-timeline">
          2019
          Got to travel to New Zealand again and visit numerous farming businesses on a three week tour.
