          I quit my job, bought a ticket and travelled to the other side of the
          world to live and work on a dairy farm in New Zealand.

          I returned home after 7 months away but still couldn't settle so
          continued my agricultural work experience in West Wales and Scotland
          (seasonally lambing for a number of years).
          Got myself a new job working in one section of the agricultural
          industry as well as starting an Agricultural degree part time.

          Changed jobs but remained within the agricultural industry.
          A job which I could work with farmers as well as broaden my knowledge
          on UK farming systems and where I am still working today.

          Completed and gained a Foundation degree in Agriculture and decided
          to top it up to a full degree over a couple more years, all whilst
          working full time. I purchased my own small flock of sheep to start
          putting into practice what I had been learning since 2014.
